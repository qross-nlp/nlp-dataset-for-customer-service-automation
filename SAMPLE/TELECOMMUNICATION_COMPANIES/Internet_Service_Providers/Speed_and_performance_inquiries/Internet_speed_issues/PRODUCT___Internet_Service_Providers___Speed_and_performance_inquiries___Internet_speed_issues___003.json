        "Adding more access points should correct the discrepancy becauseEthernet cable connections have quicker throughput than the same type of internet connecting device",
        "Data transfer can be done faster using Ethernet links and can multiple access points restore access to parity with the wireless network?",
        "It is being questioned whether adding access points will help the wi-fi being slower than ethernet.",

        "Is there a gap between them that can be closed with more access points or is it just quicker throughput with an ethernet cable connection?",
        "Installation of more access points may help bridge the gap since the reasons for offering a higher throughput on the Ethernet network is unknown."
